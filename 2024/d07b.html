  The engineers seem concerned; the total calibration result you gave them is nowhere close to being within safety tolerances. Just then, you spot your mistake: some well-hidden elephants are holding a
  <em>
   third type of operator
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation" target="_blank">
   concatenation
  </a>
  operator (
  <code>
   <span title="I think you mean &#34;.&#34;.">
    ||
   </span>
  </code>
  ) combines the digits from its left and right inputs into a single number. For example,
  <code>
   12 || 345
  </code>
  would become
  <code>
   12345
  </code>
  . All operators are still evaluated left-to-right.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, apart from the three equations that could be made true using only addition and multiplication, the above example has three more equations that can be made true by inserting operators:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    156: 15 6
   </code>
   can be made true through a single concatenation:
   <code>
    15 || 6 = 156
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    7290: 6 8 6 15
   </code>
   can be made true using
   <code>
    6 * 8 || 6 * 15
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    192: 17 8 14
   </code>
   can be made true using
   <code>
    17 || 8 + 14
   </code>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Adding up all six test values (the three that could be made before using only
  <code>
   +
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   *
  </code>
  plus the new three that can now be made by also using
  <code>
   ||
  </code>
  ) produces the new
  <em>
   total calibration result
  </em>
  of
  <code>
   <em>
    11387
   </em>
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Using your new knowledge of elephant hiding spots, determine which equations could possibly be true.
  <em>
   What is their total calibration result?
