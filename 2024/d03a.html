  --- Day 3: Mull It Over ---

 <p>
  &#34;Our computers are having issues, so I have no idea if we have any Chief Historians
  <span title="There&#39;s a spot reserved for Chief Historians between the green toboggans and the red toboggans. They&#39;ve never actually had any Chief Historians in stock, but it&#39;s best to be prepared.">
   in stock
  </span>
  ! You&#39;re welcome to check the warehouse, though,&#34; says the mildly flustered shopkeeper at the
  <a href="/2020/day/2">
   North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop
  </a>
  . The Historians head out to take a look.
 </p>
 <p>
  The shopkeeper turns to you. &#34;Any chance you can see why our computers are having issues again?&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  The computer appears to be trying to run a program, but its memory (your puzzle input) is
  <em>
   corrupted
  </em>
  . All of the instructions have been jumbled up!
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems like the goal of the program is just to
  <em>
   multiply some numbers
  </em>
  . It does that with instructions like
  <code>
   mul(X,Y)
  </code>
  , where
  <code>
   X
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   Y
  </code>
  are each 1-3 digit numbers. For instance,
  <code>
   mul(44,46)
  </code>
  multiplies
  <code>
   44
  </code>
  by
  <code>
   46
  </code>
  to get a result of
  <code>
   2024
  </code>
  . Similarly,
  <code>
   mul(123,4)
  </code>
  would multiply
  <code>
   123
  </code>
  by
  <code>
   4
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  However, because the program&#39;s memory has been corrupted, there are also many invalid characters that should be
  <em>
   ignored
  </em>
  , even if they look like part of a
  <code>
   mul
  </code>
  instruction. Sequences like
  <code>
   mul(4*
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   mul(6,9!
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   ?(12,34)
  </code>
  , or
  <code>
   mul ( 2 , 4 )
  </code>
  do
  <em>
   nothing
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, consider the following section of corrupted memory:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   x
   <em>
    mul(2,4)
   </em>
   %&amp;mul[3,7]!@^do_not_
   <em>
    mul(5,5)
   </em>
   +mul(32,64]then(
   <em>
    mul(11,8)mul(8,5)
   </em>
   )
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Only the four highlighted sections are real
  <code>
   mul
  </code>
  instructions. Adding up the result of each instruction produces
  <code>
   <em>
    161
   </em>
  </code>
  (
  <code>
   2*4 + 5*5 + 11*8 + 8*5
  </code>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  Scan the corrupted memory for uncorrupted
  <code>
   mul
  </code>
  instructions.
  <em>
   What do you get if you add up all of the results of the multiplications?
