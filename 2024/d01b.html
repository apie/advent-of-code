 <p>
  Your analysis only confirmed what everyone feared: the two lists of location IDs are indeed very different.
 </p>
 <p>
  Or are they?
 </p>
 <p>
  The Historians can&#39;t agree on which group made the mistakes
  <em>
   or
  </em>
  how to read most of the Chief&#39;s handwriting, but in the commotion you notice an interesting detail:
  <span title="We were THIS close to summoning the Alot of Location IDs!">
   a lot
  </span>
  of location IDs appear in both lists! Maybe the other numbers aren&#39;t location IDs at all but rather misinterpreted handwriting.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, you&#39;ll need to figure out exactly how often each number from the left list appears in the right list. Calculate a total
  <em>
   similarity score
  </em>
  by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here are the same example lists again:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  For these example lists, here is the process of finding the similarity score:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The first number in the left list is
   <code>
    3
   </code>
   . It appears in the right list three times, so the similarity score increases by
   <code>
    3 * 3 =
    <em>
     9
    </em>
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The second number in the left list is
   <code>
    4
   </code>
   . It appears in the right list once, so the similarity score increases by
   <code>
    4 * 1 =
    <em>
     4
    </em>
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The third number in the left list is
   <code>
    2
   </code>
   . It does not appear in the right list, so the similarity score does not increase (
   <code>
    2 * 0 = 0
   </code>
   ).
  </li>
  <li>
   The fourth number,
   <code>
    1
   </code>
   , also does not appear in the right list.
  </li>
  <li>
   The fifth number,
   <code>
    3
   </code>
   , appears in the right list three times; the similarity score increases by
   <code>
    <em>
     9
    </em>
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The last number,
   <code>
    3
   </code>
   , appears in the right list three times; the similarity score again increases by
   <code>
    <em>
     9
    </em>
   </code>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  So, for these example lists, the similarity score at the end of this process is
  <code>
   <em>
    31
   </em>
  </code>
  (
  <code>
   9 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 9
  </code>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  Once again consider your left and right lists.
