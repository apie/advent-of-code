  The engineers are surprised by the low number of safe reports until they realize they forgot to tell you about the
  <span title="I need to get one of these!">
   Problem Dampener
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The Problem Dampener is a reactor-mounted module that lets the reactor safety systems
  <em>
   tolerate a single bad level
  </em>
  in what would otherwise be a safe report. It&#39;s like the bad level never happened!
 </p>
 <p>
  Now, the same rules apply as before, except if removing a single level from an unsafe report would make it safe, the report instead counts as safe.
 </p>
 <p>
  More of the above example&#39;s reports are now safe:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    7 6 4 2 1
   </code>
   :
   <em>
    Safe
   </em>
   without removing any level.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    1 2 7 8 9
   </code>
   :
   <em>
    Unsafe
   </em>
   regardless of which level is removed.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    9 7 6 2 1
   </code>
   :
   <em>
    Unsafe
   </em>
   regardless of which level is removed.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    1
    <em>
     3
    </em>
    2 4 5
   </code>
   :
   <em>
    Safe
   </em>
   by removing the second level,
   <code>
    3
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    8 6
    <em>
     4
    </em>
    4 1
   </code>
   :
   <em>
    Safe
   </em>
   by removing the third level,
   <code>
    4
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    1 3 6 7 9
   </code>
   :
   <em>
    Safe
   </em>
   without removing any level.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Thanks to the Problem Dampener,
  <code>
   <em>
    4
   </em>
  </code>
  reports are actually
  <em>
   safe
  </em>
  !
 </p>
 <p>
  Update your analysis by handling situations where the Problem Dampener can remove a single level from unsafe reports.
