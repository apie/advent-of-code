 <h2>
  --- Day 9: Disk Fragmenter ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  Another push of the button leaves you in the familiar hallways of some friendly
  <a href="/2021/day/23">
   amphipods
  </a>
  ! Good thing you each somehow got your own personal mini submarine. The Historians jet away in search of the Chief, mostly by driving directly into walls.
 </p>
 <p>
  While The Historians quickly figure out how to pilot these things, you notice an amphipod in the corner struggling with his computer. He&#39;s trying to make more contiguous free space by compacting all of the files, but his program isn&#39;t working; you offer to help.
 </p>
 <p>
  He shows you the
  <em>
   disk map
  </em>
  (your puzzle input) he&#39;s already generated. For example:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   2333133121414131402
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  The disk map uses a dense format to represent the layout of
  <em>
   files
  </em>
  and
  <em>
   free space
  </em>
  on the disk. The digits alternate between indicating the length of a file and the length of free space.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, a disk map like
  <code>
   12345
  </code>
  would represent a one-block file, two blocks of free space, a three-block file, four blocks of free space, and then a five-block file. A disk map like
  <code>
   90909
  </code>
  would represent three nine-block files in a row (with no free space between them).
 </p>
 <p>
  Each file on disk also has an
  <em>
   ID number
  </em>
  based on the order of the files as they appear
  <em>
   before
  </em>
  they are rearranged, starting with ID
  <code>
   0
  </code>
  . So, the disk map
  <code>
   12345
  </code>
  has three files: a one-block file with ID
  <code>
   0
  </code>
  , a three-block file with ID
  <code>
   1
  </code>
  , and a five-block file with ID
  <code>
   2
  </code>
  . Using one character for each block where digits are the file ID and
  <code>
   .
  </code>
  is free space, the disk map
  <code>
   12345
  </code>
  represents these individual blocks:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   0..111....22222
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  The first example above,
  <code>
   2333133121414131402
  </code>
  , represents these individual blocks:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   00...111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888899
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  The amphipod would like to
  <em>
   move file blocks one at a time
  </em>
  from the end of the disk to the leftmost free space block (until there are no gaps remaining between file blocks). For the disk map
  <code>
   12345
  </code>
  , the process looks like this:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   0..111....22222
02.111....2222.
022111....222..
0221112...22...
02211122..2....
022111222......
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  The first example requires a few more steps:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   00...111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888899
009..111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.88889.
0099.111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.8888..
00998111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888...
009981118..2...333.44.5555.6666.777.88....
0099811188.2...333.44.5555.6666.777.8.....
009981118882...333.44.5555.6666.777.......
0099811188827..333.44.5555.6666.77........
00998111888277.333.44.5555.6666.7.........
009981118882777333.44.5555.6666...........
009981118882777333644.5555.666............
00998111888277733364465555.66.............
0099811188827773336446555566..............
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  The final step of this file-compacting process is to update the
  <em>
   filesystem checksum
  </em>
  . To calculate the checksum, add up the result of multiplying each of these blocks&#39; position with the file ID number it contains. The leftmost block is in position
  <code>
   0
  </code>
  . If a block contains free space, skip it instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  Continuing the first example, the first few blocks&#39; position multiplied by its file ID number are
  <code>
   0 * 0 = 0
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   1 * 0 = 0
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   2 * 9 = 18
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   3 * 9 = 27
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   4 * 8 = 32
  </code>
  , and so on. In this example, the checksum is the sum of these,
  <code>
   <em>
    1928
   </em>
  </code>
  .
