  --- Day 6: Guard Gallivant ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  The Historians use their fancy
  <a href="4">
   device
  </a>
  again, this time to whisk you all away to the North Pole prototype suit manufacturing lab... in the year
  <a href="/2018/day/5">
   1518
  </a>
  ! It turns out that having direct access to history is very convenient for a group of historians.
 </p>
 <p>
  You still have to be careful of time paradoxes, and so it will be important to avoid anyone from 1518 while The Historians search for the Chief. Unfortunately, a single
  <em>
   guard
  </em>
  is patrolling this part of the lab.
 </p>
 <p>
  Maybe you can work out where the guard will go ahead of time so that The Historians can search safely?
 </p>
 <p>
  You start by making a map (your puzzle input) of the situation. For example:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   ....#.....
.........#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#..^.....
........#.
#.........
......#...
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  The map shows the current position of the guard with
  <code>
   ^
  </code>
  (to indicate the guard is currently facing
  <em>
   up
  </em>
  from the perspective of the map). Any
  <em>
   obstructions
  </em>
  - crates, desks, alchemical reactors, etc. - are shown as
  <code>
   #
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Lab guards in 1518 follow a very strict patrol protocol which involves repeatedly following these steps:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   If there is something directly in front of you, turn right 90 degrees.
  </li>
  <li>
   Otherwise, take a step forward.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Following the above protocol, the guard moves up several times until she reaches an obstacle (in this case, a pile of failed suit prototypes):
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   ....#.....
....^....#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#........
........#.
#.........
......#...
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Because there is now an obstacle in front of the guard, she turns right before continuing straight in her new facing direction:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   ....#.....
........&gt;#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#........
........#.
#.........
......#...
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Reaching another obstacle (a spool of several
  <em>
   very
  </em>
  long polymers), she turns right again and continues downward:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   ....#.....
.........#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#......v.
........#.
#.........
......#...
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  This process continues for a while, but the guard eventually leaves the mapped area (after walking past a tank of universal solvent):
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   ....#.....
.........#
..........
..#.......
.......#..
..........
.#........
........#.
#.........
......#v..
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  By predicting the guard&#39;s route, you can determine which specific positions in the lab will be in the patrol path.
  <em>
   Including the guard&#39;s starting position
  </em>
  , the positions visited by the guard before leaving the area are marked with an
  <code>
   X
  </code>
  :
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   ....#.....
....XXXXX#
....X...X.
..#.X...X.
..XXXXX#X.
..X.X.X.X.
.#XXXXXXX.
.XXXXXXX#.
#XXXXXXX..
......#X..
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  In this example, the guard will visit
  <code>
   <em>
    41
   </em>
  </code>
  distinct positions on your map.
 </p>
 <p>
  Predict the path of the guard.
  <em>
   How many distinct positions will the guard visit before leaving the mapped area?
  </em>
