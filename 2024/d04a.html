  --- Day 4: Ceres Search ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  &#34;Looks like the Chief&#39;s not here. Next!&#34; One of The Historians pulls out a device and pushes the only button on it. After a brief flash, you recognize the interior of the
  <a href="/2019/day/10">
   Ceres monitoring station
  </a>
  !
 </p>
 <p>
  As the search for the Chief continues, a small Elf who lives on the station tugs on your shirt; she&#39;d like to know if you could help her with her
  <em>
   word search
  </em>
  (your puzzle input). She only has to find one word:
  <code>
   XMAS
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  This word search allows words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. It&#39;s a little unusual, though, as you don&#39;t merely need to find one instance of
  <code>
   XMAS
  </code>
  - you need to find
  <em>
   all of them
  </em>
  . Here are a few ways
  <code>
   XMAS
  </code>
  might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with
  <code>
   .
  </code>
  :
 </p>
 <p>
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   ..X...
.SAMX.
.A..A.
XMAS.S
.X....
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASX
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  In this word search,
  <code>
   XMAS
  </code>
  occurs a total of
  <code>
   <em>
    18
   </em>
  </code>
  times; here&#39;s the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any
  <code>
   XMAS
  </code>
  have been replaced with
  <code>
   .
  </code>
  :
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   ....XXMAS.
.SAMXMS...
...S..A...
..A.A.MS.X
XMASAMX.MM
X.....XA.A
S.S.S.S.SS
.A.A.A.A.A
..M.M.M.MM
.X.X.XMASX
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Take a look at the little Elf&#39;s word search.
  <em>
   How many times does
   <code>
    XMAS
   </code>
   appear?
