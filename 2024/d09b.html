  Upon completion, two things immediately become clear. First, the disk definitely has a lot more contiguous free space, just like the amphipod hoped. Second, the computer is running much more slowly! Maybe introducing all of that
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system_fragmentation" target="_blank">
   file system fragmentation
  </a>
  was a bad idea?
 </p>
 <p>
  The eager amphipod already has a new plan: rather than move individual blocks, he&#39;d like to try compacting the files on his disk by moving
  <em>
   whole files
  </em>
  instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, attempt to move whole files to the leftmost span of free space blocks that could fit the file. Attempt to move each file exactly once in order of
  <em>
   decreasing file ID number
  </em>
  starting with the file with the highest file ID number. If there is no span of free space to the left of a file that is large enough to fit the file, the file does not move.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first example from above now proceeds differently:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   00...111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888899
0099.111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.8888..
0099.1117772...333.44.5555.6666.....8888..
0099.111777244.333....5555.6666.....8888..
00992111777.44.333....5555.6666.....8888..
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  The process of updating the filesystem checksum is the same; now, this example&#39;s checksum would be
  <code>
   <em>
    2858
   </em>
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Start over, now compacting the amphipod&#39;s hard drive using this new method instead.
  <em>
   What is the resulting filesystem checksum?
  </em>
