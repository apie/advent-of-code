 <p>
  The Elf looks quizzically at you. Did you misunderstand the assignment?
 </p>
 <p>
  Looking for the instructions, you flip over the word search to find that this isn&#39;t actually an
  <code>
   <em>
    XMAS
   </em>
  </code>
  puzzle; it&#39;s an
  <span title="This part originally involved searching for something else, but this joke was too dumb to pass up.">
   <code>
    <em>
     X-MAS
    </em>
   </code>
  </span>
  puzzle in which you&#39;re supposed to find two
  <code>
   MAS
  </code>
  in the shape of an
  <code>
   X
  </code>
  . One way to achieve that is like this:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   M.S
.A.
M.S
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Irrelevant characters have again been replaced with
  <code>
   .
  </code>
  in the above diagram. Within the
  <code>
   X
  </code>
  , each
  <code>
   MAS
  </code>
  can be written forwards or backwards.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here&#39;s the same example from before, but this time all of the
  <code>
   X-MAS
  </code>
  es have been kept instead:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   .M.S......
..A..MSMS.
.M.S.MAA..
..A.ASMSM.
.M.S.M....
..........
S.S.S.S.S.
.A.A.A.A..
M.M.M.M.M.
..........
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  In this example, an
  <code>
   X-MAS
  </code>
  appears
  <code>
   <em>
    9
   </em>
  </code>
  times.
 </p>
 <p>
  Flip the word search from the instructions back over to the word search side and try again.
  <em>
   How many times does an
   <code>
    X-MAS
   </code>
   appear?
  </em>
 </p>
