  --- Day 4: Printing Department ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  You ride the escalator down to the printing department. They&#39;re clearly getting ready for Christmas; they have lots of large rolls of paper everywhere, and there&#39;s even a massive printer in the corner (to handle the really
  <span title="This joke is stupid and I love it.">
   big
  </span>
  print jobs).
 </p>
 <p>
  Decorating here will be easy: they can make their own decorations. What you really need is a way to get further into the North Pole base while the elevators are offline.
 </p>
 <p>
  &#34;Actually, maybe we can help with that,&#34; one of the Elves replies when you ask for help. &#34;We&#39;re pretty sure there&#39;s a cafeteria on the other side of the back wall. If we could break through the wall, you&#39;d be able to keep moving. It&#39;s too bad all of our forklifts are so busy moving those big rolls of paper around.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  If you can optimize the work the forklifts are doing, maybe they would have time to spare to break through the wall.
 </p>
 <p>
  The rolls of paper (
  <code>
   @
  </code>
  ) are arranged on a large grid; the Elves even have a helpful diagram (your puzzle input) indicating where everything is located.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   ..@@.@@@@.
@@@.@.@.@@
@@@@@.@.@@
@.@@@@..@.
@@.@@@@.@@
.@@@@@@@.@
.@.@.@.@@@
@.@@@.@@@@
.@@@@@@@@.
@.@.@@@.@.
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  The forklifts can only access a roll of paper if there are
  <em>
   fewer than four rolls of paper
  </em>
  in the eight adjacent positions. If you can figure out which rolls of paper the forklifts can access, they&#39;ll spend less time looking and more time breaking down the wall to the cafeteria.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this example, there are
  <code>
   <em>
    13
   </em>
  </code>
  rolls of paper that can be accessed by a forklift (marked with
  <code>
   x
  </code>
  ):
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   ..xx.xx@x.
x@@.@.@.@@
@@@@@.x.@@
@.@@@@..@.
x@.@@@@.@x
.@@@@@@@.@
.@.@.@.@@@
x.@@@.@@@@
.@@@@@@@@.
x.x.@@@.x.
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Consider your complete diagram of the paper roll locations.
