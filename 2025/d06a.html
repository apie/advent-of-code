  --- Day 6: Trash Compactor ---

 <p>
  After helping the Elves in the kitchen, you were taking a break and helping them re-enact a movie scene when you over-enthusiastically jumped into the garbage chute!
 </p>
 <p>
  A brief fall later, you find yourself in a

   garbage smasher
  </span>
  . Unfortunately, the door&#39;s been magnetically sealed.
 </p>
 <p>
  As you try to find a way out, you are approached by a family of cephalopods! They&#39;re pretty sure they can get the door open, but it will take some time. While you wait, they&#39;re curious if you can help the youngest cephalopod with her

  Cephalopod math doesn&#39;t look that different from normal math. The math worksheet (your puzzle input) consists of a list of
  <em>
   problems
  </em>
  ; each problem has a group of numbers that need to be either
  <em>
   added
  </em>
  (
  <code>
   +
  </code>
  ) or
  <em>
   multiplied
  </em>
  (
  <code>
   *
  </code>
  ) together.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the problems are arranged a little strangely; they seem to be presented next to each other in a very long horizontal list. For example:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   123 328  51 64 
 45 64  387 23 
  6 98  215 314
*   +   *   +
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Each problem&#39;s numbers are arranged vertically; at the bottom of the problem is the symbol for the operation that needs to be performed. Problems are separated by a full column of only spaces. The left/right alignment of numbers within each problem can be ignored.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, this worksheet contains four problems:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    123
   </code>
   *
   <code>
    45
   </code>
   *
   <code>
    6
   </code>
   =
   <code>
    <em>
     33210
    </em>
   </code>
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    328
   </code>
   +
   <code>
    64
   </code>
   +
   <code>
    98
   </code>
   =
   <code>
    <em>
     490
    </em>
   </code>
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    51
   </code>
   *
   <code>
    387
   </code>
   *
   <code>
    215
   </code>
   =
   <code>
    <em>
     4243455
    </em>
   </code>
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    64
   </code>
   +
   <code>
    23
   </code>
   +
   <code>
    314
   </code>
   =
   <code>
    <em>
     401
    </em>
   </code>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  To check their work, cephalopod students are given the
  <em>
   grand total
  </em>
  of adding together all of the answers to the individual problems. In this worksheet, the grand total is
  <code>
   33210
  </code>
  +
  <code>
   490
  </code>
  +
  <code>
   4243455
  </code>
  +
  <code>
   401
  </code>
  =
  <code>
   <em>
    4277556
   </em>
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the actual worksheet is
  <em>
   much
  </em>
  wider. You&#39;ll need to make sure to unroll it completely so that you can read the problems clearly.

  Solve the problems on the math worksheet.
