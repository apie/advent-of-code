 <h2>
  --- Day 5: Cafeteria ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  As the forklifts break through the wall, the Elves are delighted to discover that there was a cafeteria on the other side after all.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can hear a commotion coming from the kitchen. &#34;At this rate, we won&#39;t have any time left to put the wreaths up in the dining hall!&#34; Resolute in your quest, you investigate.
 </p>
 <p>
  &#34;If only we hadn&#39;t switched to the new inventory management system right before Christmas!&#34; another Elf exclaims. You ask what&#39;s going on.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elves in the kitchen explain the situation: because of their complicated new inventory management system, they can&#39;t figure out which of their ingredients are
  <em>
   fresh
  </em>
  and which are
  <span title="No, this puzzle does not take place on Gleba. Why do you ask?">
   <em>
    spoiled
   </em>
  </span>
  . When you ask how it works, they give you a copy of their database (your puzzle input).
 </p>
 <p>
  The database operates on
  <em>
   ingredient IDs
  </em>
  . It consists of a list of
  <em>
   fresh ingredient ID ranges
  </em>
  , a blank line, and a list of
  <em>
   available ingredient IDs
  </em>
  . For example:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   3-5
10-14
16-20
12-18

1
5
8
11
17
32
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  The fresh ID ranges are
  <em>
   inclusive
  </em>
  : the range
  <code>
   3-5
  </code>
  means that ingredient IDs
  <code>
   3
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   4
  </code>
  , and
  <code>
   5
  </code>
  are all
  <em>
   fresh
  </em>
  . The ranges can also
  <em>
   overlap
  </em>
  ; an ingredient ID is fresh if it is in
  <em>
   any
  </em>
  range.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elves are trying to determine which of the
  <em>
   available ingredient IDs
  </em>
  are
  <em>
   fresh
  </em>
  . In this example, this is done as follows:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Ingredient ID
   <code>
    1
   </code>
   is spoiled because it does not fall into any range.
  </li>
  <li>
   Ingredient ID
   <code>
    5
   </code>
   is
   <em>
    fresh
   </em>
   because it falls into range
   <code>
    3-5
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Ingredient ID
   <code>
    8
   </code>
   is spoiled.
  </li>
  <li>
   Ingredient ID
   <code>
    11
   </code>
   is
   <em>
    fresh
   </em>
   because it falls into range
   <code>
    10-14
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Ingredient ID
   <code>
    17
   </code>
   is
   <em>
    fresh
   </em>
   because it falls into range
   <code>
    16-20
   </code>
   as well as range
   <code>
    12-18
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Ingredient ID
   <code>
    32
   </code>
   is spoiled.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  So, in this example,
  <em>
   <code>
    3
   </code>
  </em>
  of the available ingredient IDs are fresh.
 </p>
 <p>
  Process the database file from the new inventory management system.
  <em>
   How many of the available ingredient IDs are fresh?
  </em>
