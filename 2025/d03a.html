  --- Day 3: Lobby ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  You descend a short staircase, enter the surprisingly vast lobby, and are quickly cleared by the security checkpoint. When you get to the main elevators, however, you discover that each one has a red light above it: they&#39;re all

  &#34;Sorry about that,&#34; an Elf apologizes as she tinkers with a nearby control panel. &#34;Some kind of electrical surge seems to have fried them. I&#39;ll try to get them online soon.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  You explain your need to get further underground. &#34;Well, you could at least take the escalator down to the printing department, not that you&#39;d get much further than that without the elevators working. That is, you could if the escalator weren&#39;t also

  .&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  &#34;But, don&#39;t worry! It&#39;s not fried; it just needs power. Maybe you can get it running while I keep working on the elevators.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  There are batteries nearby that can supply emergency power to the escalator for just such an occasion. The batteries are each labeled with their
  <a href="/2020/day/10">
   joltage
  </a>
  rating, a value from
  <code>
   1
  </code>
  to
  <code>
   9
  </code>
  . You make a note of their joltage ratings (your puzzle input). For example:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   987654321111111
811111111111119
234234234234278
818181911112111
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  The batteries are arranged into
  <em>
   banks
  </em>
  ; each line of digits in your input corresponds to a single bank of batteries. Within each bank, you need to turn on
  <em>
   exactly two
  </em>
  batteries; the joltage that the bank produces is equal to the number formed by the digits on the batteries you&#39;ve turned on. For example, if you have a bank like
  <code>
   12345
  </code>
  and you turn on batteries
  <code>
   2
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   4
  </code>
  , the bank would produce
  <code>
   24
  </code>
  jolts. (You cannot rearrange batteries.)
 </p>
 <p>
  You&#39;ll need to find the largest possible joltage each bank can produce. In the above example:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   In
   <code>
    <em>
     98
    </em>
    7654321111111
   </code>
   , you can make the largest joltage possible,
   <em>
    <code>
     98
    </code>
   </em>
   , by turning on the first two batteries.
  </li>
  <li>
   In
   <code>
    <em>
     8
    </em>
    1111111111111
    <em>
     9
    </em>
   </code>
   , you can make the largest joltage possible by turning on the batteries labeled
   <code>
    8
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    9
   </code>
   , producing
   <em>
    <code>
     89
    </code>
   </em>
   jolts.
  </li>
  <li>
   In
   <code>
    2342342342342
    <em>
     78
    </em>
   </code>
   , you can make
   <em>
    <code>
     78
    </code>
   </em>
   by turning on the last two batteries (marked
   <code>
    7
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    8
   </code>
   ).
  </li>
  <li>
   In
   <code>
    818181
    <em>
     9
    </em>
    1111
    <em>
     2
    </em>
    111
   </code>
   , the largest joltage you can produce is
   <em>
    <code>
     92
    </code>
   </em>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The total output joltage is the sum of the maximum joltage from each bank, so in this example, the total output joltage is
  <code>
   98
  </code>
  +
  <code>
   89
  </code>
  +
  <code>
   78
  </code>
  +
  <code>
   92
  </code>
  =
  <code>
   <em>
    357
   </em>
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  There are many batteries in front of you. Find the maximum joltage possible from each bank;
  <em>
   what is the total output joltage?
