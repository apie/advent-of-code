  You&#39;re sure that&#39;s the right password, but the door won&#39;t open. You knock, but nobody answers. You build a snowman while you think.
 </p>
 <p>
  As you&#39;re rolling the snowballs for your snowman, you find another security document that must have fallen into the snow:
 </p>
 <p>
  &#34;Due to newer security protocols, please use
  <em>
   password method
   <span title="You should have seen the chaos when the Elves overflowed their 32-bit password method counter.">
    0x434C49434B
   </span>
  </em>
  until further notice.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  You remember from the training seminar that &#34;method 0x434C49434B&#34; means you&#39;re actually supposed to count the number of times
  <em>
   any click
  </em>
  causes the dial to point at
  <code>
   0
  </code>
  , regardless of whether it happens during a rotation or at the end of one.
 </p>
 <p>
  Following the same rotations as in the above example, the dial points at zero a few extra times during its rotations:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The dial starts by pointing at
   <code>
    50
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The dial is rotated
   <code>
    L68
   </code>
   to point at
   <code>
    82
   </code>
   ; during this rotation, it points at
   <code>
    0
   </code>
   <em>
    once
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The dial is rotated
   <code>
    L30
   </code>
   to point at
   <code>
    52
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The dial is rotated
   <code>
    R48
   </code>
   to point at
   <code>
    <em>
     0
    </em>
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The dial is rotated
   <code>
    L5
   </code>
   to point at
   <code>
    95
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The dial is rotated
   <code>
    R60
   </code>
   to point at
   <code>
    55
   </code>
   ; during this rotation, it points at
   <code>
    0
   </code>
   <em>
    once
   </em>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The dial is rotated
   <code>
    L55
   </code>
   to point at
   <code>
    <em>
     0
    </em>
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The dial is rotated
   <code>
    L1
   </code>
   to point at
   <code>
    99
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The dial is rotated
   <code>
    L99
   </code>
   to point at
   <code>
    <em>
     0
    </em>
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The dial is rotated
   <code>
    R14
   </code>
   to point at
   <code>
    14
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The dial is rotated
   <code>
    L82
   </code>
   to point at
   <code>
    32
   </code>
   ; during this rotation, it points at
   <code>
    0
   </code>
   <em>
    once
   </em>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In this example, the dial points at
  <code>
   0
  </code>
  three times at the end of a rotation, plus three more times during a rotation. So, in this example, the new password would be
  <code>
   <em>
    6
   </em>
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Be careful: if the dial were pointing at
  <code>
   50
  </code>
  , a single rotation like
  <code>
   R1000
  </code>
  would cause the dial to point at
  <code>
   0
  </code>
  ten times before returning back to
  <code>
   50
  </code>
  !
