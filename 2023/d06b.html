  As the race is about to start, you realize the piece of paper with race times and record distances you got earlier actually just has
  <span title="Keming!">
   very bad
  </span>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning" target="_blank">
   kerning
  </a>
  . There&#39;s really
  <em>
   only one race
  </em>
  - ignore the spaces between the numbers on each line.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, the example from before:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   Time:      7  15   30
Distance:  9  40  200
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  ...now instead means this:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   Time:      71530
Distance:  940200
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Now, you have to figure out how many ways there are to win this single race. In this example, the race lasts for
  <em>
   <code>
    71530
   </code>
   milliseconds
  </em>
  and the record distance you need to beat is
  <em>
   <code>
    940200
   </code>
   millimeters
  </em>
  . You could hold the button anywhere from
  <code>
   14
  </code>
  to
  <code>
   71516
  </code>
  milliseconds and beat the record, a total of
  <code>
   <em>
    71503
   </em>
  </code>
  ways!
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   How many ways can you beat the record in this one much longer race?
  </em>
