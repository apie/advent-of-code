  --- Day 2: Cube Conundrum ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  You&#39;re launched high into the atmosphere! The apex of your trajectory just barely reaches the surface of a large island floating in the sky. You gently land in a fluffy pile of leaves. It&#39;s quite cold, but you don&#39;t see much snow. An Elf runs over to greet you.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elf explains that you&#39;ve arrived at
  <em>
   Snow Island
  </em>
  and apologizes for the lack of snow. He&#39;ll be happy to explain the situation, but it&#39;s a bit of a walk, so you have some time. They don&#39;t get many visitors up here;
  <span title="No, the Elf&#39;s name is not &#39;WOPR&#39;. It&#39;s Joshua.">
   would you like to play a game
  </span>
  in the meantime?
 </p>
 <p>
  As you walk, the Elf shows you a small bag and some cubes which are either red, green, or blue. Each time you play this game, he will hide a secret number of cubes of each color in the bag, and your goal is to figure out information about the number of cubes.
 </p>
 <p>
  To get information, once a bag has been loaded with cubes, the Elf will reach into the bag, grab a handful of random cubes, show them to you, and then put them back in the bag. He&#39;ll do this a few times per game.
 </p>
 <p>
  You play several games and record the information from each game (your puzzle input). Each game is listed with its ID number (like the
  <code>
   11
  </code>
  in
  <code>
   Game 11: ...
  </code>
  ) followed by a semicolon-separated list of subsets of cubes that were revealed from the bag (like
  <code>
   3 red, 5 green, 4 blue
  </code>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, the record of a few games might look like this:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  In game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained
  <em>
   only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes
  </em>
  ?
 </p>
 <p>
  In the example above, games 1, 2, and 5 would have been
  <em>
   possible
  </em>
  if the bag had been loaded with that configuration. However, game 3 would have been
  <em>
   impossible
  </em>
  because at one point the Elf showed you 20 red cubes at once; similarly, game 4 would also have been
  <em>
   impossible
  </em>
  because the Elf showed you 15 blue cubes at once. If you add up the IDs of the games that would have been possible, you get
  <code>
   <em>
    8
   </em>
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes.
  <em>
   What is the sum of the IDs of those games?
  </em>
