  You and the Elf eventually reach a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondola_lift" target="_blank">
   gondola lift
  </a>
  station; he says the gondola lift will take you up to the
  <em>
   water source
  </em>
  , but this is as far as he can bring you. You go inside.
 </p>
 <p>
  It doesn&#39;t take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem: they&#39;re not moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  &#34;Aaah!&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  You turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of surprise. &#34;Sorry, I wasn&#39;t expecting anyone! The gondola lift isn&#39;t working right now; it&#39;ll still be a while before I can fix it.&#34; You offer to help.
 </p>
 <p>
  The engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can
  <em>
   add up all the part numbers
  </em>
  in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.
 </p>
 <p>
  The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don&#39;t really understand, but apparently
  <em>
   any number adjacent to a symbol
  </em>
  , even diagonally, is a &#34;part number&#34; and should be included in your sum. (Periods (
  <code>
   .
  </code>
  ) do not count as a symbol.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is an example engine schematic:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  In this schematic, two numbers are
  <em>
   not
  </em>
  part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol:
  <code>
   114
  </code>
  (top right) and
  <code>
   58
  </code>
  (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so
  <em>
   is
  </em>
  a part number; their sum is
  <code>
   <em>
    4361
   </em>
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, the actual engine schematic is much larger.
  <em>
   What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?
  </em>
