  --- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  Something is wrong with global snow production, and you&#39;ve been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they&#39;ve used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.
 </p>
 <p>
  You&#39;ve been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all
  <em class="star">
   fifty stars
  </em>
  by December 25th.
 </p>
 <p>
  Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants
  <em class="star">
   one star
  </em>
  . Good luck!
 </p>
 <p>
  You try to ask why they can&#39;t just use a
  <a href="/2015/day/1">
   weather machine
  </a>
  (&#34;not powerful enough&#34;) and where they&#39;re even sending you (&#34;the sky&#34;) and why your map looks mostly blank (&#34;you sure ask a lot of questions&#34;)
  <span title="My hope is that this abomination of a run-on sentence somehow conveys the chaos of being hastily loaded into a trebuchet.">
   and
  </span>
  hang on did you just say the sky (&#34;of course, where do you think snow comes from&#34;) when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet" target="_blank">
   trebuchet
  </a>
  (&#34;please hold still, we need to strap you in&#34;).
 </p>
 <p>
  As they&#39;re making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been
  <em>
   amended
  </em>
  by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.
 </p>
 <p>
  The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific
  <em>
   calibration value
  </em>
  that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the
  <em>
   first digit
  </em>
  and the
  <em>
   last digit
  </em>
  (in that order) to form a single
  <em>
   two-digit number
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  For example:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are
  <code>
   12
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   38
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   15
  </code>
  , and
  <code>
   77
  </code>
  . Adding these together produces
  <code>
   <em>
    142
   </em>
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Consider your entire calibration document.
  <em>
   What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
  </em>
