  Of course, it would be nice to have
  <em>
   even more history
  </em>
  included in your report. Surely it&#39;s safe to just
  <em>
   extrapolate backwards
  </em>
  as well, right?
 </p>
 <p>
  For each history, repeat the process of finding differences until the sequence of differences is entirely zero. Then, rather than adding a zero to the end and filling in the next values of each previous sequence, you should instead add a zero to the
  <em>
   beginning
  </em>
  of your sequence of zeroes, then fill in new
  <em>
   first
  </em>
  values for each previous sequence.
 </p>
 <p>
  In particular, here is what the third example history looks like when extrapolating back in time:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   <em>
    5
   </em>
   10  13  16  21  30  45
   <em>
    5
   </em>
   3   3   5   9  15
   <em>
    -2
   </em>
   0   2   4   6
   <em>
    2
   </em>
   2   2   2
   <em>
    0
   </em>
   0   0
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  Adding the new values on the left side of each sequence from bottom to top eventually reveals the new left-most history value:
  <code>
   <em>
    5
   </em>
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Doing this for the remaining example data above results in previous values of
  <code>
   <em>
    -3
   </em>
  </code>
  for the first history and
  <code>
   <em>
    0
   </em>
  </code>
  for the second history. Adding all three new values together produces
  <code>
   <em>
    2
   </em>
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Analyze your OASIS report again, this time extrapolating the
  <em>
   previous
  </em>
  value for each history.
  <em>
   What is the sum of these extrapolated values?
  </em>
