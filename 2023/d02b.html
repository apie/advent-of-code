  The Elf says they&#39;ve stopped producing snow because they aren&#39;t getting any
  <em>
   water
  </em>
  ! He isn&#39;t sure why the water stopped; however, he can show you how to get to the water source to check it out for yourself. It&#39;s just up ahead!
 </p>
 <p>
  As you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each game you played, what is the
  <em>
   fewest number of cubes of each color
  </em>
  that could have been in the bag to make the game possible?
 </p>
 <p>
  Again consider the example games from earlier:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green
Game 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue
Game 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red
Game 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red
Game 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green
  </code>
 </pre>
 <ul>
  <li>
   In game 1, the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes. If any color had even one fewer cube, the game would have been impossible.
  </li>
  <li>
   Game 2 could have been played with a minimum of 1 red, 3 green, and 4 blue cubes.
  </li>
  <li>
  </li>
  <li>
   Game 3 must have been played with at least 20 red, 13 green, and 6 blue cubes.
  </li>
  <li>
   Game 4 required at least 14 red, 3 green, and 15 blue cubes.
  </li>
  <li>
   Game 5 needed no fewer than 6 red, 3 green, and 2 blue cubes in the bag.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   power
  </em>
  of a set of cubes is equal to the numbers of red, green, and blue cubes multiplied together. The power of the minimum set of cubes in game 1 is
  <code>
   48
  </code>
  . In games 2-5 it was
  <code>
   12
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   1560
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   630
  </code>
  , and
  <code>
   36
  </code>
  , respectively. Adding up these five powers produces the sum
  <code>
   <em>
    2286
   </em>
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  For each game, find the minimum set of cubes that must have been present.
  <em>
   What is the sum of the power of these sets?
