  --- Part Two ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  Just as you&#39;re about to report your findings to the Elf, one of you realizes that the rules have actually been printed on the back of every card this whole time.
 </p>
 <p>
  There&#39;s no such thing as &#34;points&#34;. Instead, scratchcards only cause you to
  <em>
   win more scratchcards
  </em>
  equal to the number of winning numbers you have.
 </p>
 <p>
  Specifically, you win
  <em>
   copies
  </em>
  of the scratchcards below the winning card equal to the number of matches. So, if card 10 were to have 5 matching numbers, you would win one copy each of cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.
 </p>
 <p>
  Copies of scratchcards are scored like normal scratchcards and have the
  <em>
   same card number
  </em>
  as the card they copied. So, if you win a copy of card 10 and it has 5 matching numbers, it would then win a copy of the same cards that the original card 10 won: cards 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. This process repeats until none of the copies cause you to win any more cards. (Cards will never make you copy a card past the end of the table.)
 </p>
 <p>
  This time, the above example goes differently:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   Card 1: 41 48 83 86 17 | 83 86  6 31 17  9 48 53
Card 2: 13 32 20 16 61 | 61 30 68 82 17 32 24 19
Card 3:  1 21 53 59 44 | 69 82 63 72 16 21 14  1
Card 4: 41 92 73 84 69 | 59 84 76 51 58  5 54 83
Card 5: 87 83 26 28 32 | 88 30 70 12 93 22 82 36
Card 6: 31 18 13 56 72 | 74 77 10 23 35 67 36 11
  </code>
 </pre>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Card 1 has four matching numbers, so you win one copy each of the next four cards: cards 2, 3, 4, and 5.
  </li>
  <li>
   Your original card 2 has two matching numbers, so you win one copy each of cards 3 and 4.
  </li>
  <li>
   Your copy of card 2 also wins one copy each of cards 3 and 4.
  </li>
  <li>
   Your four instances of card 3 (one original and three copies) have two matching numbers, so you win
   <em>
    four
   </em>
   copies each of cards 4 and 5.
  </li>
  <li>
   Your eight instances of card 4 (one original and seven copies) have one matching number, so you win
   <em>
    eight
   </em>
   copies of card 5.
  </li>
  <li>
   Your fourteen instances of card 5 (one original and thirteen copies) have no matching numbers and win no more cards.
  </li>
  <li>
   Your one instance of card 6 (one original) has no matching numbers and wins no more cards.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Once all of the originals and copies have been processed, you end up with
  <code>
   <em>
    1
   </em>
  </code>
  instance of card 1,
  <code>
   <em>
    2
   </em>
  </code>
  instances of card 2,
  <code>
   <em>
    4
   </em>
  </code>
  instances of card 3,
  <code>
   <em>
    8
   </em>
  </code>
  instances of card 4,
  <code>
   <em>
    14
   </em>
  </code>
  instances of card 5, and
  <code>
   <em>
    1
   </em>
  </code>
  instance of card 6. In total, this example pile of scratchcards causes you to ultimately have
  <code>
   <em>
    30
   </em>
  </code>
  scratchcards!
 </p>
 <p>
  Process all of the original and copied scratchcards until no more scratchcards are won. Including the original set of scratchcards,
  <em>
   how many total scratchcards do you end up with?
  </em>
