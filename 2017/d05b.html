  Now, the jumps are even stranger: after each jump, if the offset was
  <em>
   three or more
  </em>
  , instead
  <em>
   decrease
  </em>
  it by
  <code>
   1
  </code>
  . Otherwise, increase it by
  <code>
   1
  </code>
  as before.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using this rule with the above example, the process now takes
  <code>
   10
  </code>
  steps, and the offset values after finding the exit are left as
  <code>
   2 3 2 3 -1
  </code>
  .

 <p>
  <em>
   How many steps
  </em>
  does it now take to reach the exit?
