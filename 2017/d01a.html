  --- Day 1: Inverse Captcha ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  The night before Christmas, one of Santa&#39;s Elves calls you in a panic. &#34;The printer&#39;s broken! We can&#39;t print the
  <em>
   Naughty or Nice List
  </em>
  !&#34; By the time you make it to
  <span title="Floor 17: cafeteria, printing department, and experimental organic digitization equipment.">
   sub-basement 17
  </span>
  , there are only a few minutes until midnight. &#34;We have a big problem,&#34; she says; &#34;there must be almost
  <em>
   fifty
  </em>
  bugs in this system, but nothing else can print The List. Stand in this square, quick! There&#39;s no time to explain; if you can convince them to pay you in
  <em class="star">
   stars
  </em>
  , you&#39;ll be able to--&#34; She pulls a lever and the world goes blurry.
 </p>
 <p>
  When your eyes can focus again, everything seems a lot more pixelated than before. She must have sent you inside the computer! You check the system clock:
  <em>
   25 milliseconds
  </em>
  until midnight. With that much time, you should be able to collect all
  <em class="star">
   fifty stars
  </em>
  by December 25th.
 </p>
 <p>
  Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each
  <s style="text-decoration-color:#fff;">
   day
  </s>
  millisecond in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants
  <em class="star">
   one star
  </em>
  . Good luck!
 </p>
 <p>
  You&#39;re standing in a room with &#34;digitization quarantine&#34; written in LEDs along one wall. The only door is locked, but it includes a small interface. &#34;Restricted Area - Strictly No Digitized Users Allowed.&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  It goes on to explain that you may only leave by solving a
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">
   captcha
  </a>
  to prove you&#39;re
  <em>
   not
  </em>
  a human. Apparently, you only get one millisecond to solve the captcha: too fast for a normal human, but it feels like hours to you.
 </p>
 <p>
  The captcha requires you to review a sequence of digits (your puzzle input) and find the
  <em>
   sum
  </em>
  of all digits that match the
  <em>
   next
  </em>
  digit in the list. The list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the
  <em>
   first
  </em>
  digit in the list.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    1122
   </code>
   produces a sum of
   <code>
    3
   </code>
   (
   <code>
    1
   </code>
   +
   <code>
    2
   </code>
   ) because the first digit (
   <code>
    1
   </code>
   ) matches the second digit and the third digit (
   <code>
    2
   </code>
   ) matches the fourth digit.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    1111
   </code>
   produces
   <code>
    4
   </code>
   because each digit (all
   <code>
    1
   </code>
   ) matches the next.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    1234
   </code>
   produces
   <code>
    0
   </code>
   because no digit matches the next.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    91212129
   </code>
   produces
   <code>
    9
   </code>
   because the only digit that matches the next one is the last digit,
   <code>
    9
   </code>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
