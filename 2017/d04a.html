  --- Day 4: High-Entropy Passphrases ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  A new system policy has been put in place that requires all accounts to use a
  <em>
   passphrase
  </em>
  instead of simply a pass
  <em>
   word
  </em>
  . A passphrase consists of a series of words (lowercase letters) separated by spaces.
 </p>
 <p>
  To ensure security, a valid passphrase must contain no duplicate words.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    aa bb cc dd ee
   </code>
   is valid.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    aa bb cc dd aa
   </code>
   is not valid - the word
   <code>
    aa
   </code>
   appears more than once.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    aa bb cc dd aaa
   </code>
   is valid -
   <code>
    aa
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    aaa
   </code>
   count as different words.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  The system&#39;s full passphrase list is available as your puzzle input.
