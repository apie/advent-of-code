  has been put in place.  Now, a valid passphrase must contain no two words that are anagrams of each other - that is, a passphrase is invalid if any word&#39;s letters can be rearranged to form any other word in the passphrase.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    abcde fghij
   </code>
   is a valid passphrase.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    abcde xyz ecdab
   </code>
   is not valid - the letters from the third word can be rearranged to form the first word.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    a ab abc abd abf abj
   </code>
   is a valid passphrase, because
   <em>
    all
   </em>
   letters need to be used when forming another word.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    iiii oiii ooii oooi oooo
   </code>
   is valid.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    oiii ioii iioi iiio
   </code>
   is not valid - any of these words can be rearranged to form any other word.
  </li>
 </ul>
