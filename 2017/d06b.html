  Out of curiosity, the debugger would also like to know the size of the loop: starting from a state that has already been seen, how many block redistribution cycles must be performed before that same state is seen again?
 </p>
 <p>
  In the example above,
  <code>
   2 4 1 2
  </code>
  is seen again after four cycles, and so the answer in that example would be
  <code>
   4
  </code>
  .

 <p>
  <em>
   How many cycles
  </em>
  are in the infinite loop that arises from the configuration in your puzzle input?
