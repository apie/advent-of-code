 <p>
  As a stress test on the system, the programs here clear the grid and then store the value
  <code>
   1
  </code>
  in square
  <code>
   1
  </code>
  . Then, in the same allocation order as shown above, they store the sum of the values in all adjacent squares, including diagonals.
 </p>
 <p>
  So, the first few squares&#39; values are chosen as follows:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Square
   <code>
    1
   </code>
   starts with the value
   <code>
    1
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Square
   <code>
    2
   </code>
   has only one adjacent filled square (with value
   <code>
    1
   </code>
   ), so it also stores
   <code>
    1
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Square
   <code>
    3
   </code>
   has both of the above squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values,
   <code>
    2
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Square
   <code>
    4
   </code>
   has all three of the aforementioned squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values,
   <code>
    4
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   Square
   <code>
    5
   </code>
   only has the first and fourth squares as neighbors, so it gets the value
   <code>
    5
   </code>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Once a square is written, its value does not change. Therefore, the first few squares would receive the following values:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   147  142  133  122   59
304    5    4    2   57
330   10    1    1   54
351   11   23   25   26
362  747  806---&gt;   ...
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  What is the
  <em>
   first value written
  </em>
  that is
  <em>
   larger
  </em>
  than your puzzle input?
