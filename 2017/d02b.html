  &#34;Great work; looks like we&#39;re on the right track after all.  Here&#39;s a
  <em class="star">
   star
  </em>
  for your effort.&#34; However, the program seems a little worried. Can programs
  <em>
   be
  </em>
  worried?
 </p>
 <p>
  &#34;Based on what we&#39;re seeing, it looks like all the User wanted is some information about the
  <em>
   evenly divisible values
  </em>
  in the spreadsheet.  Unfortunately, none of us are equipped for that kind of calculation - most of us specialize in

  .&#34;
 </p>
 <p>
  It sounds like the goal is to find the only two numbers in each row where one evenly divides the other - that is, where the result of the division operation is a whole number. They would like you to find those numbers on each line, divide them, and add up each line&#39;s result.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, given the following spreadsheet:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   5 9 2 8
9 4 7 3
3 8 6 5
  </code>
 </pre>
 <ul>
  <li>
   In the first row, the only two numbers that evenly divide are
   <code>
    8
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    2
   </code>
   ; the result of this division is
   <code>
    4
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   In the second row, the two numbers are
   <code>
    9
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    3
   </code>
   ; the result is
   <code>
    3
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   In the third row, the result is
   <code>
    2
   </code>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In this example, the sum of the results would be
  <code>
   4 + 3 + 2 = 9
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  What is the
  <em>
   sum of each row&#39;s result
  </em>
  in your puzzle input?
