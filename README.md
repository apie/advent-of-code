How to use the cookiecutter template: `cookiecutter . -f -s dir_name=2022 day=1a`

This will generate a subdir with the new file.

Then go to the subdir and run `../get_input.bash YEAR DAY` to download your input (you might need to add your session cookie to the file `cookie.txt` first).

Test inputs can be written to files `d<DAY>.test.<#>` starting at 1, or you can write the test inputs in the python file as literals.
