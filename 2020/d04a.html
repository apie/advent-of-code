 <h2>
  --- Day 4: Passport Processing ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  You arrive at the airport only to realize that you grabbed your North Pole Credentials instead of your passport. While these documents are extremely similar, North Pole Credentials aren&#39;t issued by a country and therefore aren&#39;t actually valid documentation for travel in most of the world.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems like you&#39;re not the only one having problems, though; a very long line has formed for the automatic passport scanners, and the delay could upset your travel itinerary.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to some questionable network security, you realize you might be able to solve both of these problems at the same time.
 </p>
 <p>
  The automatic passport scanners are slow because they&#39;re having trouble
  <em>
   detecting which passports have all required fields
  </em>
  . The expected fields are as follows:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    byr
   </code>
   (Birth Year)
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    iyr
   </code>
   (Issue Year)
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    eyr
   </code>
   (Expiration Year)
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    hgt
   </code>
   (Height)
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    hcl
   </code>
   (Hair Color)
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    ecl
   </code>
   (Eye Color)
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    pid
   </code>
   (Passport ID)
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    cid
   </code>
   (Country ID)
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Passport data is validated in batch files (your puzzle input). Each passport is represented as a sequence of
  <code>
   key:value
  </code>
  pairs separated by spaces or newlines. Passports are separated by blank lines.
 </p>
 <p>
  Here is an example batch file containing four passports:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd
byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm

iyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884
hcl:#cfa07d byr:1929

hcl:#ae17e1 iyr:2013
eyr:2024
ecl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931
hgt:179cm

hcl:#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648
iyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  The first passport is
  <em>
   valid
  </em>
  - all eight fields are present. The second passport is
  <em>
   invalid
  </em>
  - it is missing
  <code>
   hgt
  </code>
  (the Height field).
 </p>
 <p>
  The third passport is interesting; the
  <em>
   only missing field
  </em>
  is
  <code>
   cid
  </code>
  , so it looks like data from North Pole Credentials, not a passport at all! Surely, nobody would mind if you made the system temporarily ignore missing
  <code>
   cid
  </code>
  fields.  Treat this &#34;passport&#34; as
  <em>
   valid
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The fourth passport is missing two fields,
  <code>
   cid
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   byr
  </code>
  . Missing
  <code>
   cid
  </code>
  is fine, but missing any other field is not, so this passport is
  <em>
   invalid
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  According to the above rules, your improved system would report
  <code>
   <em>
    2
   </em>
  </code>
  valid passports.
 </p>
 <p>
  Count the number of
  <em>
   valid
  </em>
  passports - those that have all required fields. Treat
  <code>
   cid
  </code>
  as optional.
  <em>
   In your batch file, how many passports are valid?
  </em>
