 <h2>
  --- Day 6: Custom Customs ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  As your flight approaches the regional airport where you&#39;ll switch to a much larger plane,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customs_declaration" target="_blank">
   customs declaration forms
  </a>
  are distributed to the passengers.
 </p>
 <p>
  The form asks a series of 26 yes-or-no questions marked
  <code>
   a
  </code>
  through
  <code>
   z
  </code>
  . All you need to do is identify the questions for which
  <em>
   anyone in your group
  </em>
  answers &#34;yes&#34;. Since your group is just you, this doesn&#39;t take very long.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, the person sitting next to you seems to be experiencing a language barrier and asks if you can help. For each of the people in their group, you write down the questions for which they answer &#34;yes&#34;, one per line.  For example:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   abcx
abcy
abcz
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  In this group, there are
  <em>
   <code>
    6
   </code>
  </em>
  questions to which anyone answered &#34;yes&#34;:
  <code>
   a
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   b
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   c
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   x
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   y
  </code>
  , and
  <code>
   z
  </code>
  . (Duplicate answers to the same question don&#39;t count extra; each question counts at most once.)
 </p>
 <p>
  Another group asks for your help, then another, and eventually you&#39;ve collected answers from every group on the plane (your puzzle input). Each group&#39;s answers are separated by a blank line, and within each group, each person&#39;s answers are on a single line. For example:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   abc

a
b
c

ab
ac

a
a
a
a

b
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  This list represents answers from five groups:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The first group contains one person who answered &#34;yes&#34; to
   <em>
    <code>
     3
    </code>
   </em>
   questions:
   <code>
    a
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    b
   </code>
   , and
   <code>
    c
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The second group contains three people; combined, they answered &#34;yes&#34; to
   <em>
    <code>
     3
    </code>
   </em>
   questions:
   <code>
    a
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    b
   </code>
   , and
   <code>
    c
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The third group contains two people; combined, they answered &#34;yes&#34; to
   <em>
    <code>
     3
    </code>
   </em>
   questions:
   <code>
    a
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    b
   </code>
   , and
   <code>
    c
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The fourth group contains four people; combined, they answered &#34;yes&#34; to only
   <em>
    <code>
     1
    </code>
   </em>
   question,
   <code>
    a
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The last group contains one person who answered &#34;yes&#34; to only
   <em>
    <code>
     1
    </code>
   </em>
   question,
   <code>
    b
   </code>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In this example, the sum of these counts is
  <code>
   3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1
  </code>
  =
  <em>
   <code>
    11
   </code>
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  For each group, count the number of questions to which anyone answered &#34;yes&#34;.
  <em>
   What is the sum of those counts?
  </em>
