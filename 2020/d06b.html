  As you finish the last group&#39;s customs declaration, you notice that
  <span title="Don&#39;t worry, nobody ever misreads just one word in real life.">
   you misread one word
  </span>
  in the instructions:
 </p>
 <p>
  You don&#39;t need to identify the questions to which
  <em>
   anyone
  </em>
  answered &#34;yes&#34;; you need to identify the questions to which
  <em>
   everyone
  </em>
  answered &#34;yes&#34;!
 </p>
 <p>
  Using the same  example as above:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   abc

a
b
c

ab
ac

a
a
a
a

b
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  This list represents answers from five groups:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   In the first group, everyone (all 1 person) answered &#34;yes&#34; to
   <em>
    <code>
     3
    </code>
   </em>
   questions:
   <code>
    a
   </code>
   ,
   <code>
    b
   </code>
   , and
   <code>
    c
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   In the second group, there is
   <em>
    no
   </em>
   question to which everyone answered &#34;yes&#34;.
  </li>
  <li>
   In the third group, everyone answered yes to only
   <em>
    <code>
     1
    </code>
   </em>
   question,
   <code>
    a
   </code>
   . Since some people did not answer &#34;yes&#34; to
   <code>
    b
   </code>
   or
   <code>
    c
   </code>
   , they don&#39;t count.
  </li>
  <li>
   In the fourth group, everyone answered yes to only
   <em>
    <code>
     1
    </code>
   </em>
   question,
   <code>
    a
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   In the fifth group, everyone (all 1 person) answered &#34;yes&#34; to
   <em>
    <code>
     1
    </code>
   </em>
   question,
   <code>
    b
   </code>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In this example, the sum of these counts is
  <code>
   3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1
  </code>
  =
  <em>
   <code>
    6
   </code>
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  For each group, count the number of questions to which
  <em>
   everyone
  </em>
  answered &#34;yes&#34;.
  <em>
   What is the sum of those counts?
  </em>
