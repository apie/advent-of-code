  --- Day 1: Report Repair ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  After saving Christmas
  <a href="/events">
   five years in a row
  </a>
  , you&#39;ve decided to take a vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island.
  <span title="WHAT COULD GO WRONG">
   Surely
  </span>
  , Christmas will go on without you.
 </p>
 <p>
  The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only.  The gold coins used there have a little picture of a starfish; the locals just call them
  <em class="star">
   stars
  </em>
  . None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of them, but somehow, you&#39;ll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you arrive so you can pay the deposit on your room.
 </p>
 <p>
  To save your vacation, you need to get all
  <em class="star">
   fifty stars
  </em>
  by December 25th.
 </p>
 <p>
  Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants
  <em class="star">
   one star
  </em>
  . Good luck!
 </p>
 <p>
  Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your
  <em>
   expense report
  </em>
  (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn&#39;t quite adding up.
 </p>
 <p>
  Specifically, they need you to
  <em>
   find the two entries that sum to
   <code>
    2020
   </code>
  </em>
  and then multiply those two numbers together.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   1721
979
366
299
675
1456
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  In this list, the two entries that sum to
  <code>
   2020
  </code>
  are
  <code>
   1721
  </code>
  and
  <code>
   299
  </code>
  . Multiplying them together produces
  <code>
   1721 * 299 = 514579
  </code>
  , so the correct answer is
  <code>
   <em>
    514579
   </em>
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Of course, your expense report is much larger.
  <em>
   Find the two entries that sum to
   <code>
    2020
   </code>
   ; what do you get if you multiply them together?
