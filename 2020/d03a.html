  --- Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  With the toboggan login problems resolved, you set off toward the airport. While travel by toboggan might be easy, it&#39;s certainly not safe: there&#39;s
  <span title="It looks like the toboggan steering system even runs on Intcode! Good thing you don&#39;t have to modify it.">
   very minimal steering
  </span>
  and the area is covered in trees. You&#39;ll need to see which angles will take you near the fewest trees.
 </p>
 <p>
  Due to the local geology, trees in this area only grow on exact integer coordinates in a grid. You make a map (your puzzle input) of the open squares (
  <code>
   .
  </code>
  ) and trees (
  <code>
   #
  </code>
  ) you can see. For example:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   ..##.......
#...#...#..
.#....#..#.
..#.#...#.#
.#...##..#.
..#.##.....
.#.#.#....#
.#........#
#.##...#...
#...##....#
.#..#...#.#
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  These aren&#39;t the only trees, though; due to something you read about once involving arboreal genetics and biome stability, the same pattern repeats to the right many times:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   <em>

 </pre>
 <p>
  You start on the open square (
  <code>
   .
  </code>
  ) in the top-left corner and need to reach the bottom (below the bottom-most row on your map).
 </p>
 <p>
  The toboggan can only follow a few specific slopes (you opted for a cheaper model that prefers rational numbers); start by
  <em>
   counting all the trees
  </em>
  you would encounter for the slope
  <em>
   right 3, down 1
  </em>
  :
 </p>
 <p>
  From your starting position at the top-left, check the position that is right 3 and down 1. Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there, and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.
 </p>
 <p>
  The locations you&#39;d check in the above example are marked here with
  <code>
   <em>
    O
   </em>
  </code>
  where there was an open square and
  <code>
   <em>
    X
   </em>
  </code>
  where there was a tree:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   ..##.........##.........##.........##.........##.........##.......  ---&gt;

   <em>

 </pre>
 <p>
  In this example, traversing the map using this slope would cause you to encounter
  <code>
   <em>
    7
   </em>
  </code>
  trees.
 </p>
 <p>
  Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of right 3 and down 1,
  <em>
   how many trees would you encounter?
  </em>
