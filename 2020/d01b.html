  The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer you a second one if you can find
  <em>
   three
  </em>
  numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria.
 </p>
 <p>
  Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to
  <code>
   2020
  </code>
  are
  <code>
   979
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   366
  </code>
  , and
  <code>
   675
  </code>
  . Multiplying them together produces the answer,
  <code>
   <em>
    241861950
   </em>
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  In your expense report,
  <em>
   what is the product of the three entries that sum to
   <code>
    2020
   </code>
   ?
  </em>
