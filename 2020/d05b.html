  The &#34;fasten seat belt&#34; signs have turned on. Time to find your seat.
 </p>
 <p>
  It&#39;s a completely full flight, so your seat should be the only missing boarding pass in your list.  However, there&#39;s a catch: some of the seats at the very front and back of the plane don&#39;t exist on this aircraft, so they&#39;ll be missing from your list as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  Your seat wasn&#39;t at the very front or back, though; the seats with IDs +1 and -1 from yours will be in your list.
