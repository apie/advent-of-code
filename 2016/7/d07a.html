  --- Day 7: Internet Protocol Version 7 ---

 <p>
  While snooping around the local network of EBHQ, you compile a list of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address">
   IP addresses
  </a>
  (they&#39;re IPv7, of course;
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">
   IPv6
  </a>
  is much too limited). You&#39;d like to figure out which IPs support
  <em>
   TLS
  </em>
  (transport-layer snooping).
 </p>
 <p>
  An IP supports TLS if it has an Autonomous Bridge Bypass Annotation, or
  <span title="Any similarity to the pattern it describes is purely coincidental.">
   <em>
    ABBA
   </em>
  </span>
  .  An ABBA is any four-character sequence which consists of a pair of two different characters followed by the reverse of that pair, such as
  <code>
   xyyx
  </code>
  or
  <code>
   abba
  </code>
  .  However, the IP also must not have an ABBA within any hypernet sequences, which are contained by
  <em>
   square brackets
  </em>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  For example:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    abba[mnop]qrst
   </code>
   supports TLS (
   <code>
    abba
   </code>
   outside square brackets).
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    abcd[bddb]xyyx
   </code>
   does
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   support TLS (
   <code>
    bddb
   </code>
   is within square brackets, even though
   <code>
    xyyx
   </code>
   is outside square brackets).
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    aaaa[qwer]tyui
   </code>
   does
   <em>
    not
   </em>
   support TLS (
   <code>
    aaaa
   </code>
   is invalid; the interior characters must be different).
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    ioxxoj[asdfgh]zxcvbn
   </code>
   supports TLS (
   <code>
    oxxo
   </code>
   is outside square brackets, even though it&#39;s within a larger string).
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  <em>
   How many IPs
  </em>
  in your puzzle input support TLS?
