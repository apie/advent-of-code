 <h2>
  --- Day 9: Explosives in Cyberspace ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  Wandering around a secure area, you come across a datalink port to a new part of the network. After briefly scanning it for interesting files, you find one file in particular that catches your attention. It&#39;s compressed with an experimental format, but fortunately, the documentation for the format is nearby.
 </p>
 <p>
  The format compresses a sequence of characters. Whitespace is ignored. To indicate that some sequence should be repeated, a marker is added to the file, like
  <code>
   (10x2)
  </code>
  . To decompress this marker, take the subsequent
  <code>
   10
  </code>
  characters and repeat them
  <code>
   2
  </code>
  times. Then, continue reading the file
  <em>
   after
  </em>
  the repeated data.  The marker itself is not included in the decompressed output.
 </p>
 <p>
  If parentheses or other characters appear within the data referenced by a marker, that&#39;s okay - treat it like normal data, not a marker, and then resume looking for markers after the decompressed section.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    ADVENT
   </code>
   contains no markers and decompresses to itself with no changes, resulting in a decompressed length of
   <code>
    6
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    A(1x5)BC
   </code>
   repeats only the
   <code>
    B
   </code>
   a total of
   <code>
    5
   </code>
   times, becoming
   <code>
    ABBBBBC
   </code>
   for a decompressed length of
   <code>
    7
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    (3x3)XYZ
   </code>
   becomes
   <code>
    XYZXYZXYZ
   </code>
   for a decompressed length of
   <code>
    9
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    A(2x2)BCD(2x2)EFG
   </code>
   doubles the
   <code>
    BC
   </code>
   and
   <code>
    EF
   </code>
   , becoming
   <code>
    ABCBCDEFEFG
   </code>
   for a decompressed length of
   <code>
    11
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    (6x1)(1x3)A
   </code>
   simply becomes
   <code>
    (1x3)A
   </code>
   - the
   <code>
    (1x3)
   </code>
   looks like a marker, but because it&#39;s within a data section of another marker, it is not treated any differently from the
   <code>
    A
   </code>
   that comes after it. It has a decompressed length of
   <code>
    6
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    X(8x2)(3x3)ABCY
   </code>
   becomes
   <code>
    X(3x3)ABC(3x3)ABCY
   </code>
   (for a decompressed length of
   <code>
    18
   </code>
   ), because the decompressed data from the
   <code>
    (8x2)
   </code>
   marker (the
   <code>
    (3x3)ABC
   </code>
   ) is skipped and not processed further.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  What is the
  <em>
   decompressed length
  </em>
  of the file (your puzzle input)? Don&#39;t count whitespace.
