  Apparently, the file actually uses
  <em>
   version two
  </em>
  of the format.
 </p>
 <p>
  In version two, the only difference is that markers within decompressed data
  <em>
   are
  </em>
  decompressed. This, the documentation explains, provides much more substantial compression capabilities, allowing many-gigabyte files to be stored in
  <span title="&#34;It&#39;s the bomb!&#34;, the documentation claims.">
   only a few kilobytes
  </span>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  For example:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    (3x3)XYZ
   </code>
   still becomes
   <code>
    XYZXYZXYZ
   </code>
   , as the decompressed section contains no markers.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    X(8x2)(3x3)ABCY
   </code>
   becomes
   <code>
    XABCABCABCABCABCABCY
   </code>
   , because the decompressed data from the
   <code>
    (8x2)
   </code>
   marker is then further decompressed, thus triggering the
   <code>
    (3x3)
   </code>
   marker twice for a total of six
   <code>
    ABC
   </code>
   sequences.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    (27x12)(20x12)(13x14)(7x10)(1x12)A
   </code>
   decompresses into a string of
   <code>
    A
   </code>
   repeated
   <code>
    241920
   </code>
   times.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    (25x3)(3x3)ABC(2x3)XY(5x2)PQRSTX(18x9)(3x2)TWO(5x7)SEVEN
   </code>
   becomes
   <code>
    445
   </code>
   characters long.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, the computer you brought probably doesn&#39;t have enough memory to actually decompress the file; you&#39;ll have to
  <em>
   come up with another way
  </em>
  to get its decompressed length.
 </p>
 <p>
  What is the
  <em>
   decompressed length
  </em>
  of the file using this improved format?
