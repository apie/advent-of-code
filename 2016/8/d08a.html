 <h2>
  --- Day 8: Two-Factor Authentication ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  You come across a door implementing what you can only assume is an implementation of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">
   two-factor authentication
  </a>
  after a long game of
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirement">
   requirements
  </a>
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_whispers">
   telephone
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  To get past the door, you first swipe a keycard (no problem; there was one on a nearby desk). Then, it displays a code on a
  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tiny+lcd&amp;tbm=isch">
   little screen
  </a>
  , and you type that code on a keypad. Then, presumably, the door unlocks.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, the screen has been
  <span title="BUT BY WHOM?!">
   smashed
  </span>
  . After a few minutes, you&#39;ve taken everything apart and figured out how it works. Now you just have to work out what the screen
  <em>
   would
  </em>
  have displayed.
 </p>
 <p>
  The magnetic strip on the card you swiped encodes a series of instructions for the screen; these instructions are your puzzle input. The screen is
  <em>
   <code>
    50
   </code>
   pixels wide and
   <code>
    6
   </code>
   pixels tall
  </em>
  , all of which start
  <em>
   off
  </em>
  , and is capable of three somewhat peculiar operations:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <code>
    rect AxB
   </code>
   turns
   <em>
    on
   </em>
   all of the pixels in a rectangle at the top-left of the screen which is
   <code>
    A
   </code>
   wide and
   <code>
    B
   </code>
   tall.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    rotate row y=A by B
   </code>
   shifts all of the pixels in row
   <code>
    A
   </code>
   (0 is the top row)
   <em>
    right
   </em>
   by
   <code>
    B
   </code>
   pixels. Pixels that would fall off the right end appear at the left end of the row.
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    rotate column x=A by B
   </code>
   shifts all of the pixels in column
   <code>
    A
   </code>
   (0 is the left column)
   <em>
    down
   </em>
   by
   <code>
    B
   </code>
   pixels. Pixels that would fall off the bottom appear at the top of the column.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  For example, here is a simple sequence on a smaller screen:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>
    <code>
     rect 3x2
    </code>
    creates a small rectangle in the top-left corner:
   </p>
   <pre>
    <code>
     ###....
###....
.......
    </code>
   </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <code>
     rotate column x=1 by 1
    </code>
    rotates the second column down by one pixel:
   </p>
   <pre>
    <code>
     #.#....
###....
.#.....
    </code>
   </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <code>
     rotate row y=0 by 4
    </code>
    rotates the top row right by four pixels:
   </p>
   <pre>
    <code>
     ....#.#
###....
.#.....
    </code>
   </pre>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>
    <code>
     rotate column x=1 by 1
    </code>
    again rotates the second column down by one pixel, causing the bottom pixel to wrap back to the top:
   </p>
   <pre>
    <code>
     .#..#.#
#.#....
.#.....
    </code>
   </pre>
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  As you can see, this display technology is extremely powerful, and will soon dominate the tiny-code-displaying-screen market.  That&#39;s what the advertisement on the back of the display tries to convince you, anyway.
 </p>
 <p>
  There seems to be an intermediate check of the voltage used by the display: after you swipe your card, if the screen did work,
  <em>
   how many pixels should be lit?
  </em>
