  --- Day 6: Signals and Noise ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  Something is jamming your communications with Santa. Fortunately, your signal is only partially jammed, and protocol in situations like this is to switch to a simple
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_code">
   repetition code
  </a>
  to get the message through.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this model, the same message is sent repeatedly.  You&#39;ve recorded the repeating message signal (your puzzle input), but the data seems quite corrupted - almost too badly to recover.

  .

 <p>
  All you need to do is figure out which character is most frequent for each position. For example, suppose you had recorded the following messages:
 </p>
 <pre>
  <code>
   eedadn
drvtee
eandsr
raavrd
atevrs
tsrnev
sdttsa
rasrtv
nssdts
ntnada
svetve
tesnvt
vntsnd
vrdear
dvrsen
enarar
  </code>
 </pre>
 <p>
  The most common character in the first column is
  <code>
   e
  </code>
  ; in the second,
  <code>
   a
  </code>
  ; in the third,
  <code>
   s
  </code>
  , and so on. Combining these characters returns the error-corrected message,
  <code>
   easter
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the recording in your puzzle input,

  of the message being sent?
