  Of course, that
  <em>
   would
  </em>
  be the message - if you hadn&#39;t agreed to use a
  <em>
   modified repetition code
  </em>
  instead.
 </p>
 <p>
  In this
  <span title="*Please* don&#39;t try this at home.">
   modified code
  </span>
  , the sender instead transmits what looks like random data, but for each character, the character they actually want to send is
  <em>
   slightly less likely
  </em>
  than the others. Even after signal-jamming noise, you can look at the letter distributions in each column and choose the
  <em>
   least common
  </em>
  letter to reconstruct the original message.
 </p>
 <p>
  In the above example, the least common character in the first column is
  <code>
   a
  </code>
  ; in the second,
  <code>
   d
  </code>
  , and so on. Repeating this process for the remaining characters produces the original message,
  <code>
   advent
  </code>
  .

  Given the recording in your puzzle input and this new decoding methodology,
  <em>
   what is the original message
  </em>
  that Santa is trying to send?
