 <p>
  As the door slides open, you are presented with a second door that uses a slightly more
  <span title="This one says &#39;WOPR&#39; in block letters.">
   inspired
  </span>
  security mechanism. Clearly unimpressed by the last version (in what movie is the password decrypted
  <em>
   in order
  </em>
  ?!), the Easter Bunny engineers have worked out
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHWjlCaIrQo&amp;t=25">
   a better solution
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Instead of simply filling in the password from left to right, the hash now also indicates the
  <em>
   position
  </em>
  within the password to fill. You still look for hashes that begin with five zeroes; however, now, the
  <em>
   sixth
  </em>
  character represents the
  <em>
   position
  </em>
  (
  <code>
   0
  </code>
  -
  <code>
   7
  </code>
  ), and the
  <em>
   seventh
  </em>
  character is the character to put in that position.
 </p>
 <p>
  A hash result of
  <code>
   000001f
  </code>
  means that
  <code>
   f
  </code>
  is the
  <em>
   second
  </em>
  character in the password. Use only the
  <em>
   first result
  </em>
  for each position, and ignore invalid positions.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, if the Door ID is
  <code>
   abc
  </code>
  :
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The first interesting hash is from
   <code>
    abc3231929
   </code>
   , which produces
   <code>
    0000015...
   </code>
   ; so,
   <code>
    5
   </code>
   goes in position
   <code>
    1
   </code>
   :
   <code>
    _5______
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   In the previous method,
   <code>
    5017308
   </code>
   produced an interesting hash; however, it is ignored, because it specifies an invalid position (
   <code>
    8
   </code>
   ).
  </li>
  <li>
   The second interesting hash is at index
   <code>
    5357525
   </code>
   , which produces
   <code>
    000004e...
   </code>
   ; so,
   <code>
    e
   </code>
   goes in position
   <code>
    4
   </code>
   :
   <code>
    _5__e___
   </code>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  You almost choke on your popcorn as the final character falls into place, producing the password
  <code>
   05ace8e3
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the actual Door ID and this new method,
  <em>
   what is the password
  </em>
  ? Be extra proud of your solution if it uses a cinematic &#34;decrypting&#34; animation.
