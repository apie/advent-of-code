  --- Day 5: How About a Nice Game of Chess? ---

 <p>
  You are faced with a security door designed by Easter Bunny engineers that seem to have acquired most of their security knowledge by watching

   movies
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The
  <em>
   eight-character password
  </em>
  for the door is generated one character at a time by finding the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">
   MD5
  </a>
  hash of some Door ID (your puzzle input) and an increasing integer index (starting with
  <code>
   0
  </code>
  ).
 </p>
 <p>
  A hash indicates the
  <em>
   next character
  </em>
  in the password if its
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal">
   hexadecimal
  </a>
  representation starts with
  <em>
   five zeroes
  </em>
  . If it does, the sixth character in the hash is the next character of the password.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, if the Door ID is
  <code>
   abc
  </code>
  :
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The first index which produces a hash that starts with five zeroes is
   <code>
    3231929
   </code>
   , which we find by hashing
   <code>
    abc3231929
   </code>
   ; the sixth character of the hash, and thus the first character of the password, is
   <code>
    1
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   <code>
    5017308
   </code>
   produces the next interesting hash, which starts with
   <code>
    000008f82...
   </code>
   , so the second character of the password is
   <code>
    8
   </code>
   .
  </li>
  <li>
   The third time a hash starts with five zeroes is for
   <code>
    abc5278568
   </code>
   , discovering the character
   <code>
    f
   </code>
   .
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  In this example, after continuing this search a total of eight times, the password is
  <code>
   18f47a30
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Given the actual Door ID,
  <em>
   what is the password
  </em>
  ?
