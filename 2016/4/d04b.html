  With all the decoy data out of the way, it&#39;s time to decrypt this list and get moving.
 </p>
 <p>
  The room names are encrypted by a state-of-the-art
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">
   shift cipher
  </a>
  , which is nearly unbreakable without
  <span title="...or, like, half of a napkin.">
   the right software
  </span>
  . However, the information kiosk designers at Easter Bunny HQ were not expecting to deal with a master cryptographer like yourself.

 <p>
  To decrypt a room name, rotate each letter forward through the alphabet a number of times equal to the room&#39;s sector ID.
  <code>
   A
  </code>
  becomes
  <code>
   B
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   B
  </code>
  becomes
  <code>
   C
  </code>
  ,
  <code>
   Z
  </code>
  becomes
  <code>
   A
  </code>
  , and so on. Dashes become spaces.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, the real name for
  <code>
   qzmt-zixmtkozy-ivhz-343
  </code>
  is
  <code>
   very encrypted name
  </code>
  .

  of the room where North Pole objects are stored?
